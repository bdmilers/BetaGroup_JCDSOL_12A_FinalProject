# Driving Customer Loyalty Through Churn Analysis
An ecommerce company experienced a complaint rate of up to 28% and a customer satisfaction rate of 2.9/5.0 which caused a Churn Flag of 17%. The company asked for help from the Data Analyst team to reduce the Churn rate, as well as provide recommendations to increase customer loyalty. As a team, we created a prediction model using the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier. As a result, even though the prediction model costs 40% more than the Rule-Based system, it is able to predict more than 2.3 times customer churn, so that preventive steps to reduce the churn rate can be carried out more effectively and efficiently.
